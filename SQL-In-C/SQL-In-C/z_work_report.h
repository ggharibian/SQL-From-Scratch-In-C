Features:
        -Not Implemented:
                None.

        -Implemented:
                Parser Class with the bare minimum commands and 
                functionalities.

        -Partly implemented:
                Table Class is almost fully implemented, only missing the 
                output operator due to a bug that will be fixed soon! 
                Otherwise, the table class is also complete.

    Bugs:
            None with the lab at it's current state. The only bug that hasn't
            been show is the aforementioned bug concerning the Table class.

    Reflections:
            This lab wasn't very difficult overall; with enough time and 
            effort, the product will be complete. The only issue I ran 
            into was concerning my Table class, which I recently upheaved 
            in order to make it functional to your standards professor ;). 
            Alternatively, the parser class was a piece of cake. No problems 
            with that :))).
